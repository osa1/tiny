# Unreleased

- `/switch` command added to quickly switch to a different tab using a substring
- Handle 'Del' key

# 2017/11/12: 0.3.0

- Fixed a bug that caused wrong scrolling in input field after changing nick.
- Tab completion now wraps after reaching the end/beginning (when navigating
  with TAB or arrow keys).
- Numeric reply 435 (aka. ERR_BANONCHAN) is now handled (#29).
- tiny now properly renders ACTION messages.
- `/me` command added for sending ACTION messages.
- A bug in the input field that caused crashes fixed.
- tiny now supports TLS! Add `tls: true` to your server setting in
  `.tinyrc.yml` to use. The field is optional and the default is `false`.
- Color code parser now returns default rather than panicking when color code
  is greater than 16 (#34).
- It is now possible to send messages to servers. Any messages sent to a server
  tabs will be sent to the server directly. `/msg <serv_addr> <msg>` can be used
  in `auto_cmds`, where `<serv_addr>` is the `addr` field of the server
  (specified in `.tinyrc.yml`). This can be used for e.g. server-specific login
  methods.

# 2017/10/15: 0.2.5

- `/clear` command implement for clearing tab contents (#22).
- Command line arguments are now considered as patterns to be searched in server
  addressed. tiny only connects to servers that matches at least one of the
  given patterns. Not passing any command line arguments means connecting to all
  servers in the config. Useful for connecting only a subset of servers listed
  in the config. See README as an example use.

# 2017/09/19: 0.2.4

- tiny can now connect to IPv6 servers.

# 2017/09/18: 0.2.3

- Channel name list is now reset on `RPL_NAMREPLY`. This fixes #23.
- A bug that caused "highlight" state of tabs fixed.
  (new messages in channel tabs no longer cause a tab in "highlight" state to
  move to "new message" style, #24)
- Fixed a bug that caused not updating channel status (highlight etc.) after
  `alt-{0,9}` keys (#26).

# 2017/08/05: 0.2.2

- Scrolling now scrolls one visible line rather than one complete line in the
  widget (which can be rendered as multiple lines).
- `/names` command implemented (see README).
- Key bindings `alt-{0,9}` added for switching tabs (see README).

# 2017/08/04: 0.2.1

- User tab names are now updated when the user changes their nick.
- Reverted a change made on termbox to be able to run on systems without
  terminfo files (#19).

# 2017/08/01: 0.2.0

- A bug triggered by single-digit color codes fixed.
- NickServ messages now shown in server tabs (previously: shown in privmsg tabs)
- Messages with non-visible characters are now logged without any modification.
  These characters are now filtered by the UI.
- A `msg_area` bug that caused not scrolling automatically when a new message
  arrived fixed.
- Switched to `mio` from in-house event loop for OSX support. tiny now runs on
  OSX!
- `/away` command implemented.
- `/nick` command implemented for changing nicks.
- HOME/END keys now scroll to top/bottom of a chat window.
- Colors are now fully configurable! You can live reload config changes via the
  `/reload` command. Thanks @umurgdk for the contribution!
- Fixed a bug that caused re-joining `/close`d channels on reconnect.
- tiny can now split long messages into smaller messages to make sure the
  command will fit into 512 bytes on the receiving side. (#15)
- tiny now buffers outgoing messages and only write to sockets when they're
  ready for writing. This fixes some crashes and/or losing messages.
